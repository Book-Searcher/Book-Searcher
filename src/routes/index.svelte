<h1>What is Book Searcher?ðŸ“š</h1>
<p>
  A web service, which helps you to search books using sorting and different
  filters and to find where you can read them. If you want to buy a book in the
  paper version, this service will propose the nearest store and the store with
  lowest price based on your location. You can use this app not only as
  authorized user, but also as a guest. Unfortunately, in this case you will not
  be allowed to rate and save products to your Favorites List.
