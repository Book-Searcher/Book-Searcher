<h1>What is Book Searcher?ðŸ“š</h1>
<p>
  A web service, which helps you to search books using sorting and different
  filters and to find where you can read them. If you want to buy a book, this
  service will give you a buy link. You can use this app not only as authorized
  user, but also as a guest. Unfortunately, in this case you will not be allowed
  to save products to your Favorites List.
